Yikes! This was really tough. I lost track of how many hours this took me. I feel like I've been working on this forever, and I'm still not completely happy with it. I suspect it would be a LOT easier and a LOT less time consuming to use responsive design techniques from the very beginning versus doing it on the backend.
